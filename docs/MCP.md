## ⚠️ Project Status Note

**This document is retained for reference only.** MCP is not currently used in this project.

| Aspect                       | Assessment                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **For this timesheet app**   | Not needed - no MCP servers are configured               |
| **For AI coding assistants** | Marginal value - direct APIs are preferred               |
| **Complexity**               | Adds confusion with unimplemented features               |
| **Future value**             | Low - DB access, Teams integration would use direct APIs |

**Recommendation:** If MCP integration becomes relevant in the future, revisit this document. For now, focus on direct API implementations (Microsoft Graph, PostgreSQL, Twilio).

## 🔌 What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that connects AI assistants to external tools and data sources. MCP servers provide structured access to APIs, databases, and services, allowing AI agents to perform actions on your behalf.

**Benefits for Development:**

- AI can directly interact with git, databases, cloud services
- Reduces context-switching between tools
- Enables automated workflows
- Provides real-time data access

## ⚡ Dynamic MCP (Docker MCP Toolkit)

Dynamic MCP lets agents discover and add MCP servers on-demand during a
session, without pre-configuring every server. It is enabled automatically
when clients connect through the Docker MCP Toolkit.

**Status:** Experimental (early development)

**How it works:**

- MCP Gateway exposes management tools in every session:
  - `mcp-find` (search catalog)
  - `mcp-add` (add server to session)
  - `mcp-config-set` (configure server settings)
  - `mcp-remove` (remove server)
  - `mcp-exec` (execute a tool by name)
  - `code-mode` (compose tools with JavaScript; experimental)
- Servers added dynamically are **session-scoped** and do not persist across
  new sessions.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker Desktop 4.50+ with MCP Toolkit enabled
- MCP-capable client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code)
- Client configured to connect to the MCP Gateway

**Usage examples:**

```text
What MCP servers can I use for working with SQL databases?
Add the postgres mcp server
```

**Code mode (experimental):**

- `code-mode` creates a JS tool that can coordinate multiple MCP servers.
- Runs inside a sandbox and can only interact through MCP tools.
- Not yet reliable for general use; focus on core dynamic tools for now.

**Security notes:**

- Catalog servers are built, signed, and maintained by Docker.
- Servers run in isolated containers with restricted resources.
- Credentials are injected and managed by the gateway.
- Dynamic tools can add new capabilities at runtime; apply least-privilege
  and monitor usage.

**Disable/enable dynamic tools:**

```bash
docker mcp feature disable dynamic-tools
docker mcp feature enable dynamic-tools
```

After toggling, restart connected MCP clients if they do not pick up the
change.

## 🧩 UI Rerun Models + MCP (Local Agent UX Pattern)

Some UI frameworks rerun the app script on each interaction, which breaks MCP's
need for a persistent, stateful connection. The recommended pattern is to keep
the MCP connection out of the UI loop and use the Docker MCP Gateway as a
long-lived hub.

**Key points:**

- Avoid `stdio` transport for rerun-based UIs; prefer SSE (HTTP) to decouple the UI
  lifecycle from the MCP session.
- Run the Gateway as a daemon and connect to it as a client from the UI.
- Keep the MCP session in a background worker (thread + asyncio loop) and
  communicate with the UI via queues.
- Use a periodic polling/fragment-style update loop to read output without
  re-initializing the MCP client on every interaction.

**Gateway (SSE) startup example:**

```bash
docker mcp gateway run --port 8080 --transport sse
```

**Recommended architecture:**

- UI thread: render UI, enqueue tool requests.
- Worker thread: maintain persistent `ClientSession`, execute MCP tool calls,
  push results to output queue.
- UI fragment: poll output queue and update a log/chat panel.

**Why it matters:**

- Dynamic tools (`mcp-add`) can be added mid-session and reflected in the UI.
- Tool failures are isolated from the Streamlit UI process.
- Secrets and credentials remain managed by the Gateway rather than embedded in
  the Streamlit app.

   - Consider using a secrets manager

3. **Update MCP Config**

   - Add server entry to your MCP configuration file
   - Restart your AI assistant to load new servers

4. **Test Connection**

   - Ask the AI to list available tools from the new server
   - Try a simple read-only operation first

5. **Document in Team**
   - Update this file with any project-specific configuration
   - Share credentials securely with team members

   - Limit database access to specific tables
   - Restrict API scopes to minimum required

2. **Credential Management**

   - Never commit credentials to git
   - Use environment variables or secrets managers
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Audit Logging**

   - Enable audit logs for database access
   - Monitor API usage in cloud dashboards
   - Review MCP activity periodically

4. **Network Security**
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Consider IP allowlisting for production databases
   - Use private endpoints in cloud environments
