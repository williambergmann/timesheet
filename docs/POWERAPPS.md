## 📂 App Structure (From Canvas Audit)

### Screens

The PowerApps application consists of **4 screens**:

| Screen Name         | Purpose                                        | Flask Equivalent             |

| `Screen1`           | Raw data report view (DataTable)               | ⚠️ Not implemented           |

### Data Sources (SharePoint)

The original app connects to **two SharePoint lists**:

| List Name         | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Timesheets`      | Header-level data (User, Week, Status, Total Hours)  |
| `Timesheet Lines` | Granular daily entries (Mon-Sun hours per time code) |

> **Note:** The Flask app uses a PostgreSQL database with equivalent tables: `timesheets` and `timesheet_entries`.
