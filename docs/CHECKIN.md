## 1. Which parts of the project currently carry the highest risk of errors or regressions?

### High Risk Areas:

| Area                             | Risk Level    | Reasoning                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ~~**`static/js/timesheet.js`**~~ | ~~🔴 High~~   | ✅ **Refactored** - Split into 5 modules (REQ-044). Now easier to maintain and test. |
| **`app/routes/timesheets.py`**   | 🟠 Medium     | Core business logic for CRUD, status transitions. Now has E2E test coverage.         |
| **Attachment handling**          | 🟡 Low-Med    | Storage abstraction complete (REQ-033). Production backup procedures documented.     |
| ~~**MSAL authentication flow**~~ | ~~🟠 Medium~~ | ✅ **Complete** - REQ-015 Azure AD implemented. 91% test coverage on auth routes.    |
| **CSS specificity**              | 🟡 Low        | Dark mode override required `!important` in places. Theme system planned (REQ-047).  |

### Why These Are Risky:

- **No frontend tests**: JavaScript changes are verified only by manual browser testing
- **Tight coupling**: `timesheet.js` directly manipulates DOM, calls API, and manages state—no separation
- **Status transitions**: Timesheet lifecycle (NEW→SUBMITTED→APPROVED) relies on correct backend validation; frontend can show stale state

---

## 2. If you had to simplify this project without losing functionality, where would you start and why?

### Recommended Simplification Order:

1. **Extract frontend state management**

   - Move `TimesheetModule` state into a simple store pattern
   - Separate data fetching, state, and rendering concerns
   - _Why_: Currently 1,400 lines of interleaved logic; bugs cascade

2. **Consolidate CSS files**

   - Merge `main.css`, `components.css`, and inline styles into a single design system
   - Remove duplicate selectors and `!important` overrides
   - _Why_: Three CSS files with overlapping selectors make styling unpredictable

3. **Unify notification services**

   - Create a single `NotificationService` that handles SMS, Email, and Teams
   - Abstract the channel-specific logic behind a common interface
   - _Why_: Currently Twilio, Email, and Teams are (or will be) separate implementations

4. **Simplify docker-compose**
   - Consider removing Redis if only used for SSE pub/sub (could use Postgres NOTIFY)
   - _Why_: Fewer moving parts = fewer failure modes

---

## 3. Which problems are not visible yet but will appear as the project grows?

### Hidden Scaling Issues:

| Problem                     | Trigger                                  | Impact                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **N+1 query patterns**      | 100+ timesheets with entries/attachments | Slow admin dashboard, DB connection exhaustion       |
| **File storage exhaustion** | 1,000+ attachments                       | Container disk fills, uploads fail silently          |
| **Session memory growth**   | 50+ concurrent users                     | Redis or cookie size limits hit                      |
| **SSE connection limits**   | Many open browser tabs                   | Nginx/Gunicorn worker exhaustion                     |
| **Migration conflicts**     | Multiple developers                      | Flask-Migrate auto-generated migrations can conflict |

### Emerging Complexity:

- **Role explosion**: 4 roles now, but adding "Manager" or "Auditor" requires touching many files
- **Status explosion**: Adding new timesheet statuses (e.g., "PROCESSING") requires frontend + backend changes in multiple places
- **Notification fatigue**: As channels grow (SMS, Email, Teams), preference management becomes complex

---

## 4. Which current technical decisions limit scalability or maintainability?

### Limiting Decisions:

| Decision                            | Limitation                                         | Alternative                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Attachments on local filesystem** | Single-instance only, no horizontal scaling        | Object storage (S3/R2) + signed URLs           |
| **Vanilla JS without build step**   | No tree-shaking, no TypeScript, no component reuse | Consider Vite + TypeScript for larger frontend |
| **Session-based auth with cookies** | Complicates API-first or mobile clients            | JWT tokens for API, cookies for web            |
| **Synchronous Twilio calls**        | Blocks request thread, no retry on failure         | Background job queue (RQ/Celery)               |
| **Hardcoded hour types**            | Adding new types requires code changes             | Database-driven hour type configuration        |

### Technical Debt:

- **No API versioning**: Breaking changes affect all clients immediately
- **Inline SQL in some routes**: Makes query optimization difficult
- **Dev bypass in production code path**: `if not azure_configured` logic interleaved with auth flow

---

## 5. Which parts of the code or architecture should be isolated, documented, or tested first?

### Priority Order for Hardening:

| Priority | Component                      | Action Needed                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | `app/routes/timesheets.py`     | Unit tests for status transitions, entry validation           |
| **2**    | `app/services/notification.py` | Integration tests with mocked Twilio, document retry behavior |
| **3**    | `static/js/timesheet.js`       | Extract into modules, add E2E tests with Playwright           |
| **4**    | `app/routes/auth.py`           | Document MSAL flow, test dev bypass gating                    |
| **5**    | `app/models.py`                | Document relationships, add model validation                  |

### Documentation Gaps:

- **API contract**: No OpenAPI/Swagger spec for frontend developers
- **State machine**: Timesheet status transitions undocumented
- ~~**Error codes**: No standard error response format~~ ✅ Implemented in REQ-035

---

## 6. Where can the project's actual behavior diverge from the developer's original intent?

### Divergence Points:

| Area                        | Intent                                 | Potential Divergence                                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Read-only timesheets**    | SUBMITTED/APPROVED should be immutable | Direct API calls bypass frontend checks; backend must enforce      |
| **Role permissions**        | Trainees see only Training hours       | Dropdown filtering is frontend-only; backend allows any hour type  |
| **Attachment requirements** | Field Hours require attachments        | Warning-only UI; can submit without, status becomes NEEDS_APPROVAL |
| **CSRF protection**         | All POST/PUT/DELETE require token      | External API consumers won't have token; need explicit exemption   |
| **Dev mode**                | Should only work in development        | If `FLASK_ENV` not set correctly, dev login could be exposed       |

### State Synchronization:

- **Optimistic UI**: Frontend shows success before API confirms
- **SSE delays**: Real-time updates can lag, showing stale data
- **Browser caching**: Old JavaScript served despite version bumps

---

## 7. Which patterns, abstractions, or conventions could reduce overall complexity?

### Recommended Patterns:

| Pattern                     | Current State                | Benefit                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository pattern**      | Routes directly query models | Centralize data access, easier testing            |
| **Service layer**           | Business logic in routes     | Reusable logic between routes and background jobs |
| **Event bus**               | Direct function calls        | Decouple notifications from core logic            |
| **Form validation library** | Manual validation            | Consistent error messages, less code              |
| **State machine**           | Hardcoded status checks      | Explicit transitions, audit trail                 |

### Conventions to Adopt:

- **API response envelope**: Always return `{ data: ..., error: ..., meta: ... }`
- **Error codes**: Use `TIMESHEET_NOT_FOUND` instead of "Timesheet not found"
- **File naming**: Consistent casing (`kebab-case` for CSS, `snake_case` for Python)

## 8. If someone else had to take over this project tomorrow, what would cause problems first?

### Onboarding Friction:

| Issue                                   | Pain Level  | Mitigation                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **No architecture diagram**             | 🟠 Medium   | Add to IMPLEMENTATION.md                            |
| **Implicit environment requirements**   | 🟡 Low      | Docker handles most; Azure/Twilio docs complete     |
| ~~**1,400-line JavaScript file**~~      | ~~🔴 High~~ | ✅ **Refactored** - Split into 5 modules (REQ-044)  |
| **Multiple documentation files**        | 🟡 Low      | Session logs consolidate daily progress             |
| ~~**No test suite to verify changes**~~ | ~~🔴 High~~ | ✅ **83% coverage** - 390 tests + GitHub Actions CI |

### What's Missing:

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: How to submit changes, run tests, deploy
- **Local dev quickstart**: Single command to go from clone to running app
- **Decision log**: Why was Flask chosen? Why vanilla JS? Historical context lost

## 9. Which improvements would deliver the best impact-to-effort ratio in the short term?

### Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort):

| Improvement                                      | Effort       | Impact        | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ~~**Add Playwright E2E tests for happy paths**~~ | ~~2-3 days~~ | ~~🟢 High~~   | ✅ Done (REQ-046) - 29 tests passing          |
| ~~**Split `timesheet.js` into modules**~~        | ~~1-2 days~~ | ~~🟢 High~~   | ✅ Done (REQ-044) - 5 modules created         |
| ~~**Add API response standardization**~~         | ~~1 day~~    | ~~🟢 High~~   | ✅ Done (REQ-035) - errors.py + validation.py |
| **Containerize test database**                   | 0.5 day      | 🟡 Medium     | Faster CI, isolated test runs                 |
| ~~**Add health check endpoint**~~                | ~~0.5 day~~  | ~~🟡 Medium~~ | ✅ Done (REQ-043) - /health endpoint          |

### Medium-Term Wins:

- **Background job queue for notifications** (3-5 days): Stop blocking requests on SMS sends
- **Object storage for attachments** (3-5 days): Enable horizontal scaling
