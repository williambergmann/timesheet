- Backend validation to reject non-Training entries from trainees
- Show helpful message explaining restriction

---

### REQ-014: Submit Without Attachment (Warning) (P1)

Allow users to submit timesheets with Field Hours but no attachment.

**Current Behavior:** Blocks submission

**Required Behavior:**

- Show warning: "Field Hours require attachment"

**Implementation Notes:**

- Change from blocking to warning
- Auto-set status to NEEDS_APPROVAL on submit
- Already partially implemented (warning shows)

---

### REQ-015: Azure AD Integration (P0)

Enable full Azure AD SSO for production authentication.

**Known Issue:**

- Clicking "Sign in with Microsoft" on the landing page fails if Azure credentials are not configured
- Without valid `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, users must use the dev login buttons instead
- See [AZURE.md](AZURE.md) "Microsoft Login Button Fails" section for detailed troubleshooting
- See [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) BUG-003 for duplicate key error on repeated logins

**Current Behavior:**

| Credentials Configured | Microsoft Login | Dev Login Buttons |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| ❌ Not configured      | ❌ Fails        | ✅ Shown          |
| ✅ Configured          | ✅ Works        | ❌ Hidden         |

**Desired Behavior (To Be Implemented):**

1. **Microsoft Login Button Click:**

   - Clicking "Sign in with Microsoft" should redirect to the actual Microsoft login page (`login.microsoftonline.com`)
   - User authenticates with their Microsoft 365 / Azure AD credentials
   - After successful authentication, redirect back to the app

2. **User Provisioning:**

   - On first login, create the user in the local database using Azure AD profile info
   - On subsequent logins, retrieve the existing user (no duplicate key errors)
   - Use "get or create" pattern in `app/routes/auth.py`

3. **Role Assignment (Phased Rollout):**

   | Phase   | Role Source                    | Purpose                                      |
   | ------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
   | Phase 1 | Admin by default               | Verify Microsoft authentication is working   |
   | Phase 2 | Northstar internal permissions | Evaluate user against internal role mappings |
   | Phase 3 | Azure AD group sync (optional) | Map AD groups to app roles automatically     |

   > **Note:** Phase 1 grants all Microsoft-authenticated users Admin access temporarily.
   > This confirms the OAuth flow works before integrating with Northstar's internal permission system.

4. **Fallback for Unconfigured Azure:**
   - When Azure credentials are missing, show clear message instead of error
   - Dev login buttons remain available for local development

**Implementation Notes:**

- Configure app registration, redirect URIs, and tenant settings
- Replace dev auth with Azure AD in production environments
- Fix BUG-003: Use `get_or_create` pattern for user provisioning
- See [AZURE.md](AZURE.md) for full setup and troubleshooting guide

---

### REQ-016: Auto-Redirect After Login (P0)

After successful login, redirect users directly to their appropriate view:

- **Trainee/Support/Staff** → My Timesheets (`/app`)
- **Admin** → Admin Dashboard (`/app#admin`)

**No landing page** - users go straight to their workspace.

---

### REQ-017: Dev Mode Test Logins (P0)

Display 4 clickable test login buttons on the login page:

| Role    | Button Label | Credentials     |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Trainee | 🎓 Trainee   | trainee/trainee |
| Support | 🛠️ Support   | support/support |
| Staff   | 👤 Staff     | staff/staff     |
| Admin   | 👑 Admin     | admin/password  |

**Implementation Notes:**

- Show buttons only in dev mode (when Azure credentials not configured)
- Each button logs in as that role for testing
- Style as prominent buttons on login page

| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| CSV    | Comma-separated values for Excel import |
| Excel  | Native .xlsx format                     |

---

### REQ-020: Travel Flag Visibility (P1)

Show travel status prominently on admin timesheet list.

**Features:**

---

### REQ-021: Per-Option Reimbursement Attachments (P1)

Each reimbursement type should have its own attachment requirement:

| Reimbursement Type | Attachment Required         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Car                | Mileage log or receipt      |
| Flight             | Flight receipt/confirmation |
| Food               | Receipt(s)                  |
| Other              | Supporting documentation    |

**Implementation Notes:**

- Extend Attachment model to link to reimbursement type
- Validate each selected reimbursement type has attachment
- Show warning if missing (similar to Field Hours warning)

---

### REQ-022: Holiday Awareness & Warning (P1)

Display holidays on the time entry grid and show a confirmation warning when users enter hours on a holiday.

**Features:**

- **Holiday Indicators:** Visually mark holidays on the calendar/grid (e.g., colored cell, icon, label)
- **Holiday List:** Maintain list of company-observed holidays (configurable)
- **Double-Verification Warning:** When a user enters hours on a holiday:
  - Display confirmation dialog: "This day is a holiday ([Holiday Name]). Are you sure you want to enter hours?"
  - User must confirm to proceed
  - Works for all hour types (Field, Internal, Training, etc.)
- **Holiday Hour Type:** Users can still select "Holiday" hour type for holiday pay

**Implementation Notes:**

- Store holidays in database (date, name, year) or configuration file
- Check entry dates against holiday list on input
- Show warning modal before saving hours on holiday
- Consider making holidays configurable per year
- Visual indicator should be visible before user enters hours

**Holiday Examples (US):**

- Thanksgiving
- Christmas Day

---

### REQ-023: Read-Only Submitted Timesheets (P0)

Submitted timesheets should be read-only. Users should not be able to edit a timesheet after submission until an admin rejects it.

**Current Bug:**

- Submitted timesheets still show "Select hour type to add..." dropdown
- Hour inputs are editable (not disabled)
- "Edit" button appears in Actions column
- Form action buttons (Save, Submit) are visible

**Required Behavior:**

| Status         | Editable | Can Add Hours | Can Submit | Can Delete |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Draft (NEW)    | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes     |
| Submitted      | ❌ No    | ❌ No         | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |
| Needs Approval | ❌ No\*  | ❌ No         | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |
| Approved       | ❌ No    | ❌ No         | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |

> \*Note: "Needs Approval" status should still allow attachment uploads.
> Decision pending: BUGS.md assumes NEEDS_APPROVAL is fully editable; align this table once decided.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Check `timesheet.status` when populating the form
- Hide/disable edit controls for non-draft timesheets
- Show status message explaining why editing is disabled
- See [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) for detailed implementation plan

---

### REQ-024: Travel Mileage Tracking (P1)

When "Traveled this week" is checked in Additional Information, display a **Travel Details** section for mileage entry.

**Current Bug:**

- Checking "Traveled this week" does not reveal any additional input fields
- No way to track miles driven or travel method

**Required UI Elements:**

| Field                 | Type     | Description                                   | Validation              |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| **Travel Method**     | Dropdown | Car (Personal), Car (Company), Rental, Flight | Required when traveled  |

**Display Logic:**

- Show "Travel Details" section ONLY when "Traveled this week" checkbox is checked
- Collapse/hide section when unchecked
- Calculate mileage reimbursement rate (configurable, e.g., $0.67/mile IRS rate)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add `miles_traveled` field to Timesheet model (nullable integer)
- Add `travel_method` enum field to Timesheet model
- Connect to Reimbursement Details if travel reimbursement is also needed
- Admin view should display travel icons based on travel_method

---

### REQ-025: Expanded Expense Type Dropdown (P1)

### REQ-026: Expense Amount Validation (P1)

Prevent null, empty, or invalid values in expense amount fields to avoid displaying "$null" or "$undefined".

**Current Bug:**

- Expense entries display "Car: $null" when amount is not properly set
- No client-side validation prevents empty submissions
- Backend accepts null values for reimbursement amounts

**Required Validation:**

| Rule                        | Client-Side       | Server-Side              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Amount must be a number     | ✅ type="number"  | ✅ Decimal validation    |
| Amount cannot be null/empty | ✅ required field | ✅ NOT NULL or default 0 |
| Amount must be ≥ $0.00      | ✅ min="0"        | ✅ Check constraint      |
| Amount must be ≤ $10,000    | ✅ max="10000"    | ✅ Check constraint      |
| Amount max 2 decimal places | ✅ step="0.01"    | ✅ Decimal(10,2)         |

**UI Improvements:**

- Display currency symbol ($) prefix in input field
- Default placeholder: "0.00" (not empty)
- If user clears field and submits, auto-set to $0.00
- Show inline error message for invalid amounts

**Display Formatting:**

- Always display amounts as "$X.XX" format (e.g., "$45.00" not "$45")
- For zero amounts, display "$0.00" (not "$null" or empty)
- Format negative refunds as "-$X.XX" if applicable

**Database Migration:**

- Add DEFAULT 0.00 to reimbursement_amount column
- Update existing NULL values to 0.00
- Add CHECK constraint: amount >= 0 AND amount <= 10000

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add client-side validation in timesheet form JavaScript
- Add server-side validation in `/api/timesheets` endpoint
- Update display logic in admin dashboard to handle edge cases
- Add unit tests for amount validation

---

### REQ-027: "Has Expenses" Expense Details Section (P1)

When "Has expenses" is checked in Additional Information, display an **Expense Details** section for tracking business expenses.

**Current Bug:**

- Checking "Has expenses" does not reveal any additional input fields

**Required UI Behavior:**

| Checkbox             | Shows Section         | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Field               | Type     | Description                            | Validation            |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Expense Summary** | Textarea | Brief description of expenses incurred | Max 500 chars         |
| **Total Estimated** | Number   | Estimated total expense amount         | Optional, $0-$10,000  |
| **Paid By**         | Dropdown | Company Card, Personal, Mixed          | Required when checked |

**Display Logic:**

- Show "Expense Summary" section ONLY when "Has expenses" checkbox is checked
- If BOTH "Has expenses" AND "Reimbursement needed" are checked:
  - Show both sections
  - "Reimbursement Details" inherits context from "Expense Summary"
- Collapse/hide section when unchecked

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add `expense_summary` text field to Timesheet model
- Add `expense_paid_by` enum (company_card, personal, mixed)
- This section is for general expense acknowledgment
- Detailed reimbursement line items go in "Reimbursement Details" section

## Security & Production Readiness

### REQ-029: Production Database Lifecycle (P0)

Migrations should be the only schema management mechanism in production.

**Required Behavior:**

- Remove automatic `db.create_all()` on app startup
- Apply schema changes only via Alembic/Flask-Migrate
- Deployment step runs `flask db upgrade` before starting web workers

**Implementation Notes:**

- See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) Phase 1 for rollout guidance

---

### REQ-030: Authentication & Session Hardening (P0)

Ensure the OIDC flow and session handling meet production security expectations.

**Required Behavior:**

- Validate `state` and `nonce` in the MSAL callback
- Enforce strict redirect URI handling
- Harden session cookies: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`
- Dev auth bypass only when explicitly enabled (not when env vars are missing)

---

### REQ-031: CSRF Protection for Mutating Endpoints (P0)

All authenticated `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` routes must require a CSRF token.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use Flask-WTF tokens for forms, or a double-submit cookie for AJAX
- Apply to timesheets, admin actions, attachments, and settings

---

### REQ-032: Security Baseline & Audit (P1)

Adopt the pre-deployment security checklist and keep it enforceable.

**Minimum Checklist:**

- Strong `SECRET_KEY`, no placeholder credentials in production
- Dependency scanning (e.g., Dependabot, safety, bandit)
- Container hardening (non-root user, updated base images)
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login, notifications)
- Admin action audit logging
- Explicit CORS/CSP policy if enabled
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full checklist

---

### REQ-033: Attachment Storage Strategy (P1)

Finalize durable attachment storage for production scaling.

**Required Behavior:**

- Decide between SharePoint sync (REQ-010) and object storage (S3/R2), or both
- Store attachment metadata in Postgres with stable storage keys
- Support multi-instance web deployment without shared filesystem
- Use signed URLs for downloads if object storage is selected
- Consider malware scanning for untrusted uploads

---

### REQ-034: Background Jobs & Scheduled Notifications (P1)

Move long-running work and reminders to a job queue.

**Required Behavior:**

- Use RQ or Celery for notifications, exports, and sync jobs
- Add retries and dead-letter handling
- Implement daily unsubmitted reminders (Mon-Fri) and weekly reminders
- Persist notification outcomes in the Notification table

---

### REQ-035: API Validation & Error Handling (P1)

Standardize request validation and error responses.

**Required Behavior:**

- Validate request bodies (Marshmallow, Pydantic, or equivalent)
- Use a consistent error shape: `{ "error": "...", "code": "...", "details": {...} }`
- Add global exception handlers with request IDs in logs

---

### REQ-036: Observability & Metrics (P1)

Add structured logging and basic operational metrics.

**Required Behavior:**

- Structured JSON logs with request_id, user_id, route, latency
- Generate `X-Request-ID` if missing and propagate
- Metrics for request duration, error rate, queue depth, DB/Redis errors

---

### REQ-037: Testing Coverage & Gaps (P1)

Close the top coverage gaps and raise overall coverage to 90%+.

**Required Tests:**

- `app/utils/sms.py` utilities (Twilio config + formatting)
- `app/services/notification.py` flows
- `app/routes/events.py` SSE stream + pub/sub
- `app/routes/timesheets.py` attachment upload + notes CRUD
- `app/routes/auth.py` MSAL flow + dev bypass
- See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full test plan and fixtures

---

## UX & Accessibility

### REQ-038: UX & Accessibility Backlog (P2)

Complete the remaining UI/UX items from supporting docs.

**Scope:**

- Microsoft-style login page parity (LOGIN.md)
- Responsive enhancements: swipe gestures, orientation, print styles (RESPONSIVE.md)
- Dark mode review: logo treatment, brand compliance, print styles, prefers-color-scheme (DARKMODE.md)
- Accessibility audit: keyboard navigation, focus visibility, contrast
- UI refactor patterns reference (UI.md)
- Use [WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md) for end-user flow validation

---

### REQ-039: PowerApps Data Report View (P2)

Implement the missing PowerApps `Screen1` data report view.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Build a read-only data table view for raw entries
- Decide routing (admin-only vs separate report page)
- Preserve parity with the original PowerApps report fields (POWERAPPS.md)

---

## Developer Tooling

### REQ-040: MCP Tooling Integration (P3)

Optional AI tooling integration using MCP servers.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Configure MCP servers as needed (Graph, Postgres, Twilio, Docker, Sentry)
- Follow MCP security best practices (MCP.md)
- Document credentials and scopes in team setup notes

---
